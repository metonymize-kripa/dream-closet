			<p> - We have a "vanilla" closet to start
<br>- Based on what the customer looked at, you get the closet getting filled in with #, $ value, brand, color, use case
<br>- As customers enter more info, the closet gets filled differently
<br>- In an evolved state, they can remove things from the closet, replace it... add things to it from other websites
<br>- It also becomes an idea generator over time
<br>- It also serves as an inventory of what you have
<br>- You could create plugins with Poshmark if you wanted to sell something </strong></p>
