# The Dream Closet

- We have a "vanilla" closet to start
- Based on what the customer looked at, you get the closet getting filled in with #, $ value, brand, color, use case
- As customers enter more info, the closet gets filled differently
- In an evolved state, they can remove things from the closet, replace it... add things to it from other websites
- It also becomes an idea generator over time
- It also serves as an inventory of what you have
- You could create plugins with Poshmark if you wanted to sell something
